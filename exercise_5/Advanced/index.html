            <h1>C++</h1>
            <p>
                "Welcome to the rest of your life"
                is a rather pretentious introduction for the first graphics assignment featuring C++ and OpenGL, but if you stick with us, it will likely hold true.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you have some experience with building C++ for Unix and Windows, you can skip this paragraph and continue with OpenGL 4.5.

                The building of C++ seems rather involved if you are a beginner and used to java or, Knuth forbid, javascript.
                Building for Unix is very simple as it involves the execution of a makefile.
                Building for Windows is generally tantamount with building in Visual Studio.
                The difficulty in both cases is the understanding of the tools.
            </p>

            <h2>Makefiles and Unix</h2>

            <p>
                As with everything else here, this is just a primer.
                You should read <a href="https://www.google.de/search?q=tutorial+Makefile">tutorials</a> to learn more.
                I our example the action is in this line:
            </p>

            <code>
                $(TARGET): $(OBJS)
                $(CXX) $(LFLAGS) $(LDFLAGS) $(CXXFLAGS) $(CFLAGS) $(INCLUDES) -o $(TARGET) $(OBJS) $(LIBS)
            </code>

            <p>
                If you put in the place holders, you see that we call the g++ compiler with some options, some pointers to include dependencies, some libraries and the source code that contains our program.
            </p>

            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li><code>INCLUDES</code> is a sequence of directories where we store the header files of external libraries.</li>
                    <li><code>LFLAGS</code> is a sequence of directories where we store the external libraries themselves. </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>LIBS</code> is a sequence of external libraries themselves.
                        An <b>external library</b> contains existing code that you have not written but want to use.
                        You have no knowledge of what the library contains, for that you need the header files (hopefully stored in <code>INCLUDES</code>).
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h2>Visual Studio and Windows</h2>

            <p>
                If you are a Windows user and working from home, you will need the <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/post-download-vs/?sku=community&clcid=0x407&telem=ga">Community edition of Visual Studio 2015</a>.
                If you are a Windows developer  that does not use VS, you are hardcore and do not need any help (some might argue on this, though).
                Visual Studio organizes a project using <code>.vcxproj</code> files.
                Those contain the same information as the makefile but rely heavily on the graphical user interface.
                You can have a look at the properties by right click on the project in the Solution Explorer >> Properties >> C/C++.
                If you read through the tree structure you will find
            </p>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li><code> C/C++ >> Additional Include Directories</code> is a sequence of directories where we store the header files of external libraries.</li>
                    <li><code> Linker >> Additional Library Directories</code> is a sequence of directories where we store the external libraries themselves. </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>Linker >> Input >> Additional Dependencies </code> is a sequence of external libraries themselves.
                        An <b>external library</b> contains existing code that you have not written but want to use.
                        You have no knowledge of what the library contains, for that you need the header files.
                    </li>
                    <li><code>Debugging >> Environment</code>: Here you can edit system variables such as <code>PATH=./contrib/bin/win32;$(PATH)</code> so that your executable finds the libraries. It will only work from within VS, though.</li>
                </ul>

            </p>


            <h2>Debugging C++</h2>

            <p>
                There are two kinds of error that you will encounter.
                That is not true but if you have no experience with C++, it will serve.
                One comes from mistakes in your source code and another from your project setup.
                The first error is up to you: Search for that missing semicolon.
                The second kind of errors stems from an incomplete project setup,
                which means that you either forgot a path to a header or library, or forgot to add the library to your compilation command, or forgot to actually include the header in your source code.
                A Google search will generally point you in the right direction.
            </p>

            <h1>OpenGL 4.5</h1>

            <p>

                Learning a graphics API is a requirement for computer graphics.
                We use OpenGL as it is free and not bound to Windows.
                You already know a fair share of WebGL and are familiar with the basic functionality of GPUs.
                We will continue introducing the core concepts in our Basic Exercises.

                However, our Advanced Exercises will use the latest features of the API.

                We provide you a framework of working API calls.
                You will add functionality.
            </p>


            <h1>Using Transformation Libraries</h1>

            <p>
                Transformations and computer graphics have now been around for quite some time and there are many existing libraries that solve the basic tasks such as multiplying and rotating matrices.
                There is absolutely <b>no</b> need to <b>implement</b> a vector rotation by <b>yourself</b>.
                There are many libraries available with different merits or just different names and fan bases.
                We use the <a href="http://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.8/index.html">glm</a> as it has "gl" in its name (Really, that is the only reason. It is completely independent of the API.).
                Depending on the version or machine or configuration of the library, the results may vary. For example, you can rotate using <b>degrees</b> (That is the convention where the full circle is $360°$.) or <b>radians</b> (A circle is $2\pi$). Make certain which notation you are using.

            </p>


                <h1>SDL2 and GLEW2</h1>

				<p>
				Our application applies the <a href="https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php">SDL2</a> for its window and event management.
				It is provided in the <b>Huber CIP</b>. If you require it elsewhere, you should know how to compile it.
				
				We also apply the GL extension library  <a href="http://glew.sourceforge.net/">GLEW 2.0</a>. The GLEW library provides all GL functions beyond the absolute basics.
				The installed GLEW version is <b>too old</b>.
				You find the correct library here:
				<center>
					<code>/proj/i9cg/contrib/lib</code>
				</center>				
				
				</p>
					
            <h1>Using Quaternions</h1>

            <p>
                <b>Always normalize quaternions after modifying them.</b> A quaternion is a compact way of encoding rotations. They do <b>not</b> contain <b>angles</b> and <b>axes</b>. However, the glm provides functions that create them that way.
            </p>
	
            <h1>Lambda Functions</h1>

            <p>
				You might notice that we assign a couple of braces to the animate function of each <code>SceneNode</code>.
				These braces define a <a href="https://www.google.de/search?q=c%2B%2B+lambda+function">Lambda function</a>. A lambda function can be assigned to a  <a href="https://www.google.de/search?q=c%2B%2B+std%3A%3Afunction">std::function</a> that we can use to execute some node specific animations.
			</p>

            <h1>Controller Scheme</h1>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Stop program via ESC.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Disable mouse capture by uncommenting <code>SDL_SetRelativeMouseMode(SDL_TRUE);</code>.

                    </li>
                </ul>

            <exercise prefix="Advanced Exercise" title="Solar System" points="10">

                <task title="Advanced Solar System" points=7>

                    <p>
                        You have some experience with transformations from our 2D solar system.
                        This task is similar and a little more complex.
                        Again, you are to create a sun, along with planets and moons.
                        But instead of stacking the transformations during rendering, we put some emphasis on the <b>scene graph</b>.
                        The scene graph is a hierarchical structure of <b>scene nodes</b>  with facilities for rendering and transformations.
                        Each node  stores the position, the rotation and the scale of a current transformation as well as a list of children.
                        The transformation can be stored in a $4\times4$ <b>model matrix</b>, which contains the rotation,  translation and scale, or we can store it separately.
                        We choose to store the information using one <b>quaternion</b>, one <b>vector</b> and one <b>scalar</b>.
                        <br>
                        By traversing the scene graph  from the root to the leaves (or planets) we compute the matrices for every scene node.
                        Once we have the current transformation, we hand it to the children.
                        This has the effect that the moon will always follow the movement of the earth.
                        The reason for that is that the revolution of the earth is contained in the lunar transformation as well via its parent-child relation.

                    </p>



                    <figure>
                        <center>



                            <img width="550" src="resources/images/scenegraph.svg" alt="Scenegraph">

                            <figcaption>
                                Exemplary scenegraph for a solar system transformation hierachy. <b>Not complete</b>, as it does not include the tilt of planets.
                            </figcaption>
                        </center>
                    </figure>


                    <h4>Order of Transformation</h4>

                    <p>
                        As a novice to computer graphics, you will likely have difficulties in replicating a complex combination of transformations.
                        The task is made even more difficult by the multitude of libraries and transformation representations.
                        It is therefore important that you are consistent. Matrices are always appended from the same side (left).
                        In the following, A is multiplied before B:
                        \begin{equation}
                        \text{B} * \text{A} * v.
                        \end{equation}

                        There are reasons for doing it like that and you will acquire a feeling for the specifics eventually.
                        Below you see two exemplary transformations that demonstrate the results of rotations followed by translations and vice versa.
                    </p>

                    <figure>
                        <center>

                            <img width="550" src="resources/images/transformation.svg" alt="Transformation">

                            <figcaption>
                                The order of transformation in the hierarchy affects the final result. If you attach a rotation prior to a translation, you can simulate a revolution.
                                If you want to simulate a rotation but with an offset you have to translate first and then rotate.

                    <h4>The Solar System</h4>

                    <p>
                        If you compile and execute the provided skeleton you will see a yellow sphere that is supposed to be the sun.

                        The <b>camera</b> is working and quite sophisticated. You can study at your convenience.

                    <h4>The Exercise</h4>
                    <p>
                        Implement a solar system with the following appearance.
                        The required information can be found on Wikipedia: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial_tilt">tilt</a> and <a href="http://www.bobthealien.co.uk/table.htm">speed and distances</a>.

                        The scale and distances are up to you.
                        Find values for the scales and distances that make sense and be aware that there is a <b>far plane</b>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                The sun in the center with tilt and rotation.

                            <li>
                                The moon with tilt, rotation and revolution.

                            <li>
                                The saturn with tilt, rotation and revolution and rings.

                        </ul>
                    </p>


                </task>

                <task title="Attaching the Camera to Transformation Nodes" points=3>
                    <p>
                        There is something called the duality of scene and camera.
                        That means it does not matter if you move the scene away from the camera or the camera away from the scene.
                        Likewise  does it  not matter if you rotate the world to the right (centered around the camera) or the camera to the left. You get the picture.

                        The <code>SceneNode</code> class has a pointer to the camera.
                        Once it is attached it will <b>override</b> the camera position and rotation.
                    </p>

                    <p>

                        Implement the override of the camera transformation in <code>SceneNode::updateTransformation</code>.
                        Note that if you want to invert the rotation of a quaternion, you have to disassemble and reassemble it from axis and angle.

                    </p>


                </task>

				   <task title="Bonus: Implement an Animation Sequence" points=1>
                    <p>
					The animate function allows you to define any transformation, driven by any available information.
					
					You can, for example define a (global) vector of transformations, storing key frames of a path.
					You can then attach the camera to it to make it move on its own.
					There are additional challenges to this problem such as making the path smooth and the speed constant. 				.
