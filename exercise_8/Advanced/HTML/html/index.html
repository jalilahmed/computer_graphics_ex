                    In this exercise we try to fake some volumetric shadows that are cast by the asteroids, enhance the appearance of the cloud layer of the earth and introduce a very simple geometry shader for inverting the orientation of triangles.

                <h2>Blending </h2>

                <p>
                    Blending describes the combination of several layers of fragments.
                    <br>
                    The default approach for rendering so far displayed only the the closest layer.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Rendering of opaque (non-transparent) and transparent geometry must be done in multiple passes.
                    We have to separate the rendering of opaque and transparent objects.
                    The rendering order is as follows:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Enable depth write (That is a default setting, otherwise we see geometry that should be occluded. <b>Do not confuse this with depth testing!</b>).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Render the opaque objects.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Enable blending.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Disable depth write (If we have many layers of transparent objects, we want to render all of them.
                        With depth write enabled, the closest would prevent the ones farther away from being drawn.).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Render the transparent objects.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Disable blending.
                    </li>
                </ol>


                <p>
                    OpenGL provides a blending function <a href="https://www.opengl.org/sdk/docs/man/html/glBlendFunc.xhtml">glBlendFunc</a>.
                    When blending, there is a <b>source</b> and a <b>destination</b>.
                    The source is the fragment that is newly drawn (the closest transparent object).
                    The destination	is the color already on screen (for example, the opaque elements).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The blending function is complex and can be heavily configured.
                    We want to achieve a <a>linear interpolation</a> between the old color and the new color using the $\alpha$ value of the new object as interpolant:
                    \begin{equation}
                    C  = \alpha_{new} C_{new} + (1-\alpha_{new}) C_{old}
                    \end{equation}
                    This happens internally, we cannot access $C_{old}$ in the fragment shader.
                    <br>
                    Instead we render $C_{old}$ first, then enable blending.
                    We set the <code>sfactor</code> to <code>GL_SRC_ALPHA</code>; and <code>dfactor</code> to <code>GL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA</code>.
                    Then we render $C_{new}$.
                </p>

                <h2>Geometry Shader and Back Face Culling </h2>

                <p>
                    Triangles have two sides or faces.
                    Generally, we are only interested in the "outside" of a triangle as the inside is hidden by the hull of the object.
                    The GPU renders both indiscriminately <b>unless</b> we enable <a href="https://www.opengl.org/wiki/Face_Culling">back face culling</a>.
                    The orientation of triangles is determined by the vertex placement and immutable.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The cloud layer of the earth is a texture painted on a sphere.
                    That means that an observer on the earth surface cannot see clouds.
                    We could disable back face culling for the cloud geometry.
                    Alternatively, we can flip the orientation of triangles that point away from us, as it is a nice problem for the introduction of the <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry-Shader">geometry shader</a>:
                    A geometry shader is part of the shader pipeline between the vertex shader and the dehomogenization (!!!) and before the primitive assembly.
                    The input of this shader are the vertex position and <b>varyings</b> of the vertex stage.
                    The output are the varyings that are expected in the fragment shader.
                    We can create additional triangles or lines for every old triangle, or we can modify the old triangle and compute face normals, for example.
                    We can also <b>swap the orientation</b> by inverting the vertex sequence.
                </p>


                <h2>Asteroid Shadows</h2>

                <p>
                    We want to draw shadows for the asteroids.
                    There are many algorithms for shadow computation, we do not care about them and simply fake the shadows.

                </p>
                <p>

                    Our approach is as follows: The asteroids cast a shadow on the dust that surrounds them.
                    The shadows fade out, that means they get narrower with increasing distance from the sun.
                    We implement the shadows by <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extrusion">extruding</a> the asteroid faces to a vanishing point on the side turned away from the sun.
                    This vanishing point can be computed using the <b>asteroid center</b>, the <b>light direction</b> and a fixed distance, say <b>11</b>.
                </p>

                         The decision for extrusion is based on the vertex normal.
                         That is an approximation which erroneously allows the extrusion of triangles that are facing the light source!

                          (Tip: Draw a 2D cut of a light source and a box with different vertex normals.).
