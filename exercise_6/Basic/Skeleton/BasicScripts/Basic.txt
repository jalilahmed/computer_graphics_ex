In Gouraud shading the color of each vertex is computed and then interpolated across the surface of the fragment.
Gouraud is better then the Flat shading but we notice that at low number of line segments the color after the middle doesnt not change much and stays at a brighter shade. In phong shading the
problem doenst because the color is obtained by interpolating the normal vectors per vertex and then computing the color for each point.
